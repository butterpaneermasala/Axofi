AxoFi - The Volatility Dam for Mantle Network

Regenerate your savings with guaranteed returns.

AxoFi is a consumer-facing Fixed Yield Savings Protocol built on Mantle Network. It acts as a "Volatility Dam," stripping the variable yield from assets like mUSD and mETH to offer users a secure, fixed-term deposit product.

Why AxoFi?

- Predictability: Convert volatile, variable yields into a known, fixed return so users can plan finances without uncertainty.
- Simplicity: Deposit a supported asset and receive a principal token that represents a guaranteed payout at maturity.
- Safety: The protocol separates risky future yield from the safe principal immediately, reducing exposure to future market fluctuations.

How it helps users

- Lock in returns today: Users receive a clear, fixed outcome for their deposit rather than exposure to future APY swings.
- Composability: Principal tokens are ERC-20 compatible and can be used across DeFi for lending, collateral, or trading.
- Test-friendly: Demo tools and mocks let users and auditors reproduce economic scenarios in local/testnet environments.

Roadmap (high level)

- Mainnet integration: Replace mocks with real market makers and router integrations.
- Term options: Add multiple fixed-term maturities (3m / 6m / 12m).
- Better UX: Zappers and fiat onboarding to make deposits seamless.
